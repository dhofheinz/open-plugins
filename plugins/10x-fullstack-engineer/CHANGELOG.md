## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added - Major Skill Modularization

**Six Standalone Skills** (replacing monolithic `/fullstack` sub-commands):

#### 1. Architecture Skill (`/architect`)
- **design** - Design new system architectures with comprehensive layer coverage
- **review** - Review existing architectures with scored assessments (0-10 scale)
- **adr** - Create Architectural Decision Records with alternative analysis
- **assess** - Architecture health assessment with 6 dimensions (technical debt, security, performance, scalability, maintainability, cost)
- **Utility Scripts**: `analyze-dependencies.sh`, `complexity-metrics.py`, `diagram-generator.sh`
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive 28KB README with workflows and examples

#### 2. Debug Skill (`/debug`)
- **diagnose** - Comprehensive root cause analysis across all stack layers
- **reproduce** - Issue reproduction strategies with automated test generation
- **fix** - Targeted fix implementation with verification and prevention measures
- **analyze-logs** - Deep log analysis with pattern detection and anomaly identification
- **performance** - Performance debugging, profiling, and optimization
- **memory** - Memory leak detection, analysis, and optimization
- **Utility Scripts**: `analyze-logs.sh`, `profile.sh`, `memory-check.sh`
- **Documentation**: 20KB README with debugging workflows and scenarios

#### 3. Feature Implementation Skill (`/feature`)
- **implement** - Full-stack feature implementation (4-phase approach)
- **database** - Database layer implementation only
- **backend** - Backend layer implementation only
- **frontend** - Frontend layer implementation only
- **integrate** - Integration and polish phase
- **scaffold** - Boilerplate generation for new features
- **Feature Types**: Authentication, real-time, data management, payments, file upload, search
- **Documentation**: 16KB README with quality standards and examples

#### 4. Performance Optimization Skill (`/optimize`)
- **analyze** - Comprehensive performance analysis across all layers
- **database** - Database query and schema optimization
- **backend** - Backend API and algorithm optimization
- **frontend** - Frontend bundle and rendering optimization
- **infrastructure** - Infrastructure and deployment optimization
- **benchmark** - Performance benchmarking and regression testing
- **Utility Scripts**: `profile-frontend.sh`, `analyze-bundle.sh`, `query-profiler.sh`, `load-test.sh`
- **Documentation**: 24KB README with performance metrics and improvement examples

#### 5. Code Refactoring Skill (`/refactor`)
- **analyze** - Code quality analysis with complexity, duplication, and coverage metrics
- **extract** - Extract methods, classes, modules, components (6 extraction types)
- **patterns** - Design pattern introduction (Factory, Strategy, Observer, DI, Repository, Decorator)
- **types** - TypeScript type safety improvements (5 strategies)
- **duplicate** - Code duplication elimination (4 consolidation strategies)
- **modernize** - Legacy code modernization (6 modernization targets)
- **Utility Scripts**: `analyze-complexity.sh`, `detect-duplication.sh`, `verify-tests.sh`
- **Documentation**: 28KB README with safety checklist and refactoring techniques

#### 6. Code Review Skill (`/review`)
- **full** - Comprehensive review covering all categories
- **security** - Security-focused audit with OWASP Top 10 coverage
- **performance** - Performance analysis and optimization recommendations
- **quality** - Code quality review (organization, naming, error handling, testing)
- **pr** - Pull request review with git integration
- **accessibility** - Accessibility audit with WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Review Depths**: Quick (5-10min), Standard (20-30min), Deep (45-60+min)
- **Documentation**: 20KB README with review checklists and workflows

### Enhanced
- **Modular Architecture**: Each skill now has specialized sub-operations instead of monolithic commands
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: 136KB of README documentation (3,658 lines) across all skills
- **Utility Scripts**: 13 executable automation scripts for analysis, profiling, and optimization
- **Safety-First Approaches**: Pre-checks, incremental changes, and verification in all refactoring operations
- **Measurable Metrics**: Before/after measurements in optimization and refactoring operations
- **Agent Integration**: All operations leverage the 10x-fullstack-engineer agent

### Technical Details
- **53 operation files** created across 6 skills
- **13 utility scripts** implemented with proper error handling
- **6 comprehensive README files** with usage examples and best practices
- **Total implementation**: ~168KB of skill operations + ~136KB of documentation
- **Backward compatible**: Original `/fullstack` commands remain functional

### Changed
- Architecture: Monolithic sub-commands → Modular skill-based operations
- Granularity: Single operations → Multiple specialized sub-operations per skill
- Documentation: Single README → Individual READMEs per skill with detailed workflows

### Deprecated
- Direct usage of `/fullstack <operation>` commands (still functional but recommend using standalone skills)
- Users should migrate to: `/architect`, `/debug`, `/feature`, `/optimize`, `/refactor`, `/review`

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Additional language-specific optimizations
- Integration with testing frameworks
- Enhanced CI/CD integration examples
- Cross-skill workflow automation
- Performance benchmark baseline management
