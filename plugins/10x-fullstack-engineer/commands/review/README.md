# Code Review Skill

Comprehensive code review system with specialized operations for different review types and focus areas. Provides structured, actionable feedback with priority levels and detailed analysis across security, performance, quality, accessibility, and PR reviews.

## Overview

The review skill orchestrates multi-category code reviews through a router-based architecture. Each operation targets specific review concerns while maintaining consistent output formats and depth levels.

## Integration with 10x-fullstack-engineer Agent

All review operations leverage the **10x-fullstack-engineer** agent for:
- Cross-stack expertise (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
- Pattern recognition across different tech stacks
- Best practices knowledge (React, Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Constructive, actionable feedback
- Architectural understanding
- Security awareness (OWASP, common vulnerabilities)
- Performance optimization techniques

## Review Best Practices

### For Reviewers
1. **Be Specific**: Always include file paths and line numbers
2. **Be Constructive**: Suggest solutions, not just problems
3. **Explain Why**: Help understand reasoning behind recommendations
4. **Provide Examples**: Show both problematic and corrected code
5. **Acknowledge Good Work**: Recognize strengths and good practices
6. **Prioritize by Impact**: Security and data integrity first
7. **Be Actionable**: Every issue should have clear next steps
8. **Ask Questions**: When intent is unclear, ask rather than assume

### For Code Authors
1. **Provide Context**: Explain design decisions in PR descriptions
2. **Address Critical Issues First**: Focus on üö® and ‚ö†Ô∏è items
3. **Ask for Clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask
4. **Update Tests**: Add tests for issues found
5. **Document Decisions**: Update docs based on feedback
6. **Iterative Improvement**: Don't try to fix everything at once

## Testing & Validation

Reviews recommend testing approaches:

### Security Testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit, pip-audit)
- Manual penetration testing for critical areas
- OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for web apps
- Security unit tests (auth, validation)

### Performance Testing
- Load testing (k6, Artillery, Locust)
- Profiling (Chrome DevTools, clinic.js)
- Bundle analysis (webpack-bundle-analyzer)
- Lighthouse audits

### Accessibility Testing
- Automated tools (axe-core, pa11y, Lighthouse)
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color contrast analyzers

## Customization

### Adding Focus Areas
```bash
# Add custom focus to any review
/review full scope:"API layer" depth:"standard" focus:"error handling and logging"
```

### Adjusting Depth
- **Quick**: Time-constrained, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD gates
- **Standard**: Regular PR reviews, feature completeness checks
- **Deep**: Pre-production, security audits, architecture reviews

### Combining Operations
For complex reviews, run multiple operations:
```bash
# 1. Full review for baseline
/review full scope:"feature" depth:"standard"

# 2. Deep dive on specific concern
/review security scope:"feature auth logic" depth:"deep"

# 3. Performance analysis
/review performance scope:"feature data loading" depth:"standard"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Review scope too large"
**Solution**: Break into smaller reviews
```bash
# Instead of:
/review full scope:"entire application" depth:"deep"

# Do:
/review full scope:"authentication module" depth:"deep"
/review full scope:"payment module" depth:"deep"
/review full scope:"user management" depth:"deep"
```

### "Not enough context provided"
**Solution**: Be more specific about scope
```bash
# Instead of:
/review security scope:"code" depth:"standard"

# Do:
/review security scope:"src/auth module - JWT validation and session management" depth:"standard"
```

### "Need faster reviews"
**Solution**: Use quick depth for initial pass
```bash
# Quick pass first
/review quality scope:"new feature" depth:"quick"

# Then deep dive on issues found
/review security scope:"authentication logic" depth:"deep"
```
