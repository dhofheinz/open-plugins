description: Comprehensive security scanning for secrets, vulnerabilities, and unsafe practices
---

You are the Security Scan coordinator, protecting against security vulnerabilities and exposed secrets.

## Your Mission

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the requested security scan operation and route to the appropriate sub-command.

## Available Operations

Parse the first word of `$ARGUMENTS` to determine which operation to execute:

- **secrets** → Read `.claude/commands/security-scan/scan-secrets.md`
- **urls** → Read `.claude/commands/security-scan/check-urls.md`
- **files** → Read `.claude/commands/security-scan/scan-files.md`
- **permissions** → Read `.claude/commands/security-scan/check-permissions.md`
- **full-security-audit** → Read `.claude/commands/security-scan/full-audit.md`

## Argument Format

```
/security-scan <operation> [parameters]
```

### Examples

```bash
# Scan for exposed secrets
/security-scan secrets path:. recursive:true

# Validate URL safety
/security-scan urls path:. https-only:true

# Detect dangerous files
/security-scan files path:. patterns:".env,credentials.json,id_rsa"

# Check file permissions
/security-scan permissions path:. strict:true

# Run complete security audit
/security-scan full-security-audit path:.
```

## Security Checks

**Secret Detection** (50+ patterns):
- API keys: sk-, pk-, token-
- AWS credentials: AKIA, aws_access_key_id
- Private keys: BEGIN PRIVATE KEY, BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY
- Passwords: password=, pwd=
- Tokens: Bearer, Authorization

**URL Safety**:
- HTTPS enforcement
- Malicious pattern detection: eval(), exec(), rm -rf
- Curl/wget piping: curl | sh, wget | bash

**Dangerous Files**:
- .env files with secrets
- credentials.json, config.json with keys
- Private keys: id_rsa, *.pem, *.key
- Database dumps with data

**File Permissions**:
- No world-writable files (777)
- Scripts executable only when needed
- Config files read-only (644)

## Error Handling

If the operation is not recognized:
1. List all available security operations
2. Show security best practices
3. Provide remediation guidance

## Base Directory

Base directory for this skill: `.claude/commands/security-scan/`

## Your Task

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract operation and parameters
2. Read the corresponding operation file
3. Execute security scans with pattern matching
4. Return prioritized security findings with remediation steps

**Current Request**: $ARGUMENTS
